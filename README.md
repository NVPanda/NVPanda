- 💬 Ask me about ...

  My name is Natã Vitor, the community of gamers and friends call me as Panda, NVPanda means Natã Vitor Panda.
  I am a solo learning programmer that enjoyed python, javascript, html, css, C, C++, C#, Delphi and i love Electronjs.
  I never put a great project here, because i never had the oportunity to work with programming,
  but i love programming, tecnology and all the things behind these terms.

  If i can make the difference, please, let me do.
